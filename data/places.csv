Approved,City of Homes,Springfield,Massachusetts,,0,"City of Homes is an innovative affordable housing initiative led by Way Finders that redevelops vacant and blighted properties in Springfield, Massachusetts into affordable homes for low- and moderate-income families. Launched in 2022 and supported by philanthropic and public partners, the program adjusted the attorney receivership model to allow for nonprofit property acquisitions, which addresses racial and economic inequities in homeownership and stabilizes long-disinvested neighborhoods. With ten units already underway and ongoing independent evaluation, City of Homes is refining a scalable model that builds generational wealth and strengthens community resilience.",677,"City of Homes introduces a new tool in the affordable housing landscape by blending philanthropy, public investment, and legal innovation. It not only expands access to homeownership for communities of color historically shut out of the market, but also demonstrates how redevelopment of vacant properties can create generational wealth and long-term neighborhood stability. Recognition through the 2024 Massachusetts Bond Bill and the Gateway Cities Innovator Award underscores its potential as a replicable model.",515,"Economic Mobility & Generational Wealthbuilding, Housing",Urban,"152,600",2025,0.4783,"“We are thrilled that MassMutual Foundation is supporting the expansion of this initiative,” says Keith Fairey, President and CEO of Way Finders. “When we take long-neglected properties, renovate them, and offer them at affordable prices, we accomplish three important goals.

Request Pending,Play Equity Fund,Los Angeles,California,,0,"In Los Angeles, philanthropy is advancing play equity — the idea that every young person, regardless of zip code, race, or income, deserves access to sports, recreation, and safe spaces to play. Rather than building new infrastructure from scratch, funders channel resources through the Play Equity Fund (PEF), a trusted intermediary that strengthens neighborhood organizations already working on the ground. This approach reweaves a fragmented system into a cohesive movement, amplifying small, hyper-local groups and ensuring that investments reflect community priorities across one of the nation’s most diverse and sprawling cities.",635,"A defining feature of Los Angeles’s approach to play equity is the creation of “intentional randomness,” ensuring every young person has access to small but pivotal opportunities that can alter a life’s trajectory. As Derek Steele of the Social Justice Learning Institute explains, those opportunities may feel random to the young person (a teacher’s encouragement, a parent insisting on soccer practice) but they are intentionally created by caring adults and community programs. By partnering with organizations like PEF to strengthen sports-based youth development and reimagine the built environment, LA’s play equity movement is making those life-changing moments more common, accessible, and equitable across neighborhoods.",729,"Sports, Community Leadership, Care Support Systems, Public Space, Youth Leadership",Urban,"3,879,000",2024,0.5,,,,"the Social Justice Learning Institute, Youth ‘N Motion Academy, Play Equity Fund, LA84 Foundation, Nike",,Planned,,,,,,,34.0549076,-118.242643
